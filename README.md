# Build Machine Learning Model Using Random Forest

Here we used R language and its *caret* and *randomForest* libraries to build classifying predicting model based on a given dataset.  The dataset were splitted into training dataset and testing dataset.  The training dataset was used to calculate and create the fitting model using "Random Forest Method",  the testing dataset was used to get the accuracy rate of the model.
